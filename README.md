# Project Scopioe:

## Overview

This project is a fully functional React.js application that converts a Figma design into a responsive web application. It includes login functionality using Firebase, dynamic data display with search functionality, and is styled using Tailwind CSS. The application uses `react-router-dom` for navigation and ensures proper route protection for authenticated routes.

## Key Features

- **Figma to React.js Conversion**: Convert the provided Figma design into a React.js application that is responsive and visually consistent.
- **Login Functionality**: Implement a login page using Firebase for authentication and user session management. Redirect users to a protected route upon successful login.
- **React Router Setup**: Manage application navigation using `react-router-dom` with routes for login, main content, and other required pages. Ensure proper route protection.
- **Dynamic Data Display**: Fetch and display dynamic data with search functionality. Display the data in a user-friendly format consistent with the Figma design.
- **Styling with Tailwind CSS**: Style the application components using Tailwind CSS to match the Figma design and ensure responsiveness.

## Technology Used

1. **Figma to React.js Implementation**:

   - **Description**: Transform the provided Figma design into a fully responsive and visually consistent React.js application.
   - **Technologies Used**: React.js for building the user interface, Tailwind CSS for styling, and Figma as the design source.

2. **Authentication Functionality**:

   - **Description**: Develop a login page leveraging Firebase for authentication and user session management. Ensure users are redirected to a protected route upon successful login.
   - **Technologies Used**: Firebase for authentication, React Router for navigation and route protection, and React Hot Toast for user feedback.

3. **Routing Configuration**:

   - **Description**: Utilize `react-router-dom` to manage the application's navigation, including routes for the login page, main content pages, and any additional required pages. Guarantee proper route protection for authenticated routes.
   - **Technologies Used**: React Router for managing routes and navigation, ensuring a seamless user experience across different sections of the application.

4. **Dynamic Data Rendering**:

   - **Description**: Create a component that retrieves and displays dynamic data, with search functionality, in a user-friendly format that aligns with the Figma design.
   - **Technologies Used**: React.js for building dynamic components, simulated data sources (e.g., static JSON or mock APIs) for data retrieval, and Tailwind CSS for styling the data display.

5. **Tailwind CSS Styling**:
   - **Description**: Apply Tailwind CSS to style the application components, ensuring consistency with the Figma design and responsiveness across different devices.
   - **Technologies Used**: Tailwind CSS for styling and ensuring the application is visually appealing and responsive.
